Memes are culture. Let‚Äôs make them governable.

Kensei is a SocialFi platform built on the SUI blockchain, designed to transform meme coins from fleeting hype into sustainable, community-driven assets. We provide a social and governance layer that empowers holders, creators, and communities to collaborate, vote, and shape the future of their tokens.

## üöÄ Why Kensei?

Meme coins often lack structure, transparency, and post-launch governance. They're typically launched, pumped, and then abandoned, leaving investors without a say in the project's direction. Kensei addresses this by:

- Providing each meme coin with its own social profile, token feed, and governance layer
- Enabling holders to create proposals and vote on token-related decisions
- Facilitating discussions and updates through on-chain forums and polls
- Allowing easy buying, selling, or swapping of tokens via a natural language chatbot
